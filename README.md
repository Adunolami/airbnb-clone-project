### Importance of Identifying Design Properties of a Mockup Design
Understanding the design properties of a mockup is essential for:
1. **Maintaining Consistency**: Ensures uniform styling across all components, which enhances the professional look of the application.
2. **Accurate Development**: Provides clear guidelines for developers, reducing the chances of misinterpreted designs.
3. **Time Efficiency**: Clear specifications save time by reducing back-and-forth consultations between designers and developers.
4. **User Experience**: By adhering to well-planned design properties, the interface becomes more intuitive and visually appealing for users.
5. **Scalability**: Standardized design properties make it easier to introduce new features or pages in the future without design inconsistencies.


By exploring and understanding the **Figma** environment and identifying these design properties, we can ensure a cohesive, user-centric interface for the Airbnb Clone project. üé®
